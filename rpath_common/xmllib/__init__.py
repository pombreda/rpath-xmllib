"""
The rPath Common Library Module for XML parsing.

This module provides a stable interface for reading and writing
rPath-generated XML files.  This interface will be
backward-compatible within major versions of this package.
The C{VERSION} data element is a string containing the version.
The portion of the string before the initial C{.} charater is the
major version.

All interfaces in this modules that do not start with a C{_}
character are public interfaces.

If the C{VERSION} starts with C{0.}, none of the included
interfaces is stable and they may change without warning.

To use the latest version of the interface::

    from rpath_common import xmllib

To use a specific API Version of the interface::

    from rpath_common.xmllib import api1 as xmllib
"""

# Default to current API version
#pylint: disable-msg=W0401
from rpath_common.xmllib.api1 import *

# Import the automatically-generated VERSION
#pylint: disable-msg=W0212
from rpath_common.xmllib.xmllib_constants import _VERSION as VERSION
