To add a NEWS entry, create a file in the "news" directory in the format
<issue>.<type>.
e.g. CNY-1234.bugfix

If you don't have an issue ID, use the prefix "misc-" with some short
identifier that won't collide with others' work.
e.g. misc-pickle-flavors.feature
e.g. misc-refactored-frobnicator.internal

These are the supported types, in the order in which they will appear:

    Type        NEWS Header
------------------------------------
    feature     New Features
    bugfix      Bug Fixes
    internal    Internal Changes

When writing the NEWS entry, put the entire entry on one line or
immediately adjacent lines. If you wish to make multiple entries for
the same issue, put one on each line with a blank line between them.

Do not repeat the issue ID in the entry -- it will be appended
automatically (if applicable)

For example:
echo Clone operations no longer print an error in the callback. \
    > news/CNY-3413.bugfix
hg add news/CNY-3413.bugfix
